N2  - Abstract Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a crucial yet relatively unexplored class of transcripts known for their tissue- and cell-type-specific expression patterns. Despite the advances in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, these technologies face difficulties in effectively profiling circRNAs due to inherent limitations in circRNA sequencing efficiency. To address this gap, a deep learning model, CIRI-deep, is presented for comprehensive prediction of circRNA regulation on diverse types of RNA-seq data. CIRI-deep is trained on an extensive dataset of 25 million high-confidence circRNA regulation events and achieved high performances on both test and leave-out data, ensuring its accuracy in inferring differential events from RNA-seq data. It is demonstrated that CIRI-deep and its adapted version enable various circRNA analyses, including cluster- or region-specific circRNA detection, BSJ ratio map visualization, and trans and cis feature importance evaluation. Collectively, CIRI-deep's adaptability extends to all major types of RNA-seq datasets including single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data, which will undoubtedly broaden the horizons of circRNA research.
